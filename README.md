# DSMC_HTML_Generator

This is a little HTML generator I'm creating for work.  The statistical programmer working on the
study needed to put together a bunch of images and HTML snippets together, however keeping track
of the various filenames and getting them into both the table of contents and the body proved to be
a frustating task.

This program attempts to generate a bare-bones HTML page gathering the various images and tables
into the document.

This is a work in progress, I'll put more info here as I complete this.
